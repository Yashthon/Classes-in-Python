# Classes-in-Python

1. Write a program to implement inheritance, create a class named aspolygon. Input the number of sides of a polygon and display them. Createa class named as triangle which inherits properties from polygon andcalculates and displays area of the triangle.

2. Write a program to define a class named Shape and its subclass Square.The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument.
Both classes have an area function which can print the area of the shape
where Shape&
39;s area is 0 by default.

3. Write a program to create a class, Triangle. Itâ€™s init() method shouldtake self, angle1, angle2, and angle3 as arguments. Create a variable and set it equal to 3. Create a method in which the sum of a triangle&
39;s three angles is: It should return true if the sum of self.angle1, self.angle2, and self.angle3 is equal 180, and False otherwise.

4. Write a program to create base class Vehicle and derived classes Bus and Car. Implement inheritance, include required attributes and methods for all the three classes.

5. Write a Python class to find the three elements that sum to zero from a set of n real numbers.
Input : [-25, -10, -7, -3, 2, 4, 8, 10]
Output : [[-10, 2, 8], [-7, -3, 10]]

6. Using class implement: Queue and all its operations

7. Using class implement: Stack and all its operations
